This application is designed to show Hard Drive activity, as many modern machines/laptops no longer show this informaton this litte app brings back that ability.
Built by Carl Hamilton, inspired from the work of Barnacules.
The application takes little resources and can be used at startup. I use this application personally.

This application will be modified over time to add more features and tracking data.
